# The Cut Back App

With this app the user can log the difference between how much they would ordinarily and how much they cut back that day. The app will convert that amount into a dollar equivalent and log it. The data logged will then be automatically analyzed and displayed to the user in a meaningful way via graphs and totaling amount saved. This app is designed to help people who aren't interested in quitting but wouldn't mind cutting back.
